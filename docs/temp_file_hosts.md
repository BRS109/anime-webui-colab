# Uploading to temporary file hosts

This colab notebook utilizes uploading to temporary file storages if you don't want to copy your generations to your Google Drive or just simply a backup if copying to Google Drive fails.

This document will explain what are the features of the sites available to be uploaded into.

## [bashupload.com](https://bashupload.com)
> Upload files from command line to easily share between servers, desktops and mobiles, **50G max**. Files are stored for **3 days and can be downloaded only once**.

## [keep.sh](https://keep.sh/)
> A free bucket is provided by keep.sh for public use. Files are **limited to 500MB** and are **deleted 24 hours after upload**

## [temp.sh](https://temp.sh/)
**AS OF 2022-01-07 YOU CANNOT UPLOAD USING THIS SITE. Please use another host.**

Site claims that you can upload **any sized** files, but I am unsure. Since several sources says that this site allows uploads for up to **10Gb**
